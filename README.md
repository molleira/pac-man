### About
The project has been created with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavasCript**. It uses several JavaScript methods and was built with the intention to learn-by-doing while having fun at the same time.

### Development
In the future I intend to improve the program and make it more effective implementing newer functionality from *ES6*, *ES7* and *TypeScript*. I would also like to improve the UI to make it more attractive.

### Usage
Please let me know if you would like to use this project as a template to create your personal project. I'll be happy to get in touch and help with whatever you need.
